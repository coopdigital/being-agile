# Working together over working alone

## Why is this important to us
The most important part of our job is problem-solving. Writing code is only one small part of the larger story of what we do, since that's only implementing the solution to a problem.

There are many domains that compose the solution to a problem: business processes, security, operability, UI/UX. The systems we create to generate value for the Co-op is the sum of these concerns, therefore they cannot be considered in isolation from each other.

## Patterns: what does this mean?
It means working collaboratively with others, both within and outwith your own discipline.

There are many ways to collaborate, and the validity of your choice is dependent on the situation the collaborators find themselves in:
- Mob/ensemble working is a group of people, probably from different disciplines, working together on one particular problem.
- Pairing is two people working on a single problem. They may or may not be from different disciplines.
- Solo work, where a single person is working on a single problem.

Each of these ways of working has their own benefits, as well as their own challenges if we are going to produce a consistent quality of outcome. Teams will swap between different modes of working depending on the types of problem they are trying to solve. It could be that a team has a default way of working, which not always be appropriate.

## Anti-patterns: what does this not mean?
It doesn't mean just using one single tool. Mobbing is just one tool in the toolbox.

It doesn't mean you must have all roles involved in all work. Why have a designer sat in a mob that's renewing a TLS certificate? That just leads to disengagement from the team by people who don't have anything to add.

It doesn't mean collaborators must stick together throughout the work. A single problem will not retain a single shape throughout the process of solving it. As the problem changes shape, the team must respond in kind. What starts as a mob may turn into a pair and a number of solo workers for a time, and this is OK.

For example, it doesn't mean six people sit around a screen while one of them spends an afternoon reading some documentation. This solo worker can bring this knowledge back to the group later.

## If we're not mobbing from dawn until dusk, what are we supposed to do?
The rest of the work that makes up the job of an engineer.

This includes, and is not limited to:
- Understanding the problem you're working on
- Adding information to upcoming tickets in the backlog
- Learning more about your tools
- Personal development

## If mobbing and collaboration aren't the same thing, then what's happening with the world?
Mobbing is one form of collaboration, and there are many other ways to collaborate.

In our field, these include, and are not limited to:
- Pairing
- Chatting over a coffee
- Code reviews
- Pairing/mobbing briefly to agree a design, before separating to implement it
- Documenting solutions for both others and your future self
