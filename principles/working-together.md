# Working together over working alone

## Why is this important to us
The most important part of our job is problem solving. Writing code is least important part, since that's only implementing the solution to a problem. The important bit happens before that.

There are many different domains that compose the solution to a problem: business processes, security, operability, UI/UX. The software we write to generate value for the Co-op is the sum of these concerns, therefore that cannot be considered in isolation from each other.

## What does this mean?
It means working collaboratively with others, both within and without your own discipline.

There are many ways to collaborate, and the validity of your choice is dependent on the situation the collaborators find themselves in.

## What does this not mean
It doesn't mean "mobbing until you die". Mobbing is a tool in our toolbox, and is only appropriate in some situations.

It doesn't mean you must have all roles involved in all work. Why have a designer sat in a mob that's renewing a TLS certificate? That just leads to disengagement from the team by people who don't have anything to add.

It doesn't mean collaborators must stick together throughout the work. The point of collaboration is knowledge transfer. Once knowledge has been transfered, the collaborators are free to go their separate ways.

It doesn't mean six people sit around a screen while one of them spends an afternoon reading some documentation.

## A note on "mobbing until you die"
Mobbing is good at sharing information between the members of the team about how the solution to a problem is implemented, but it is a very poor tool for solving the problem. Mobbing to solve a problem is just brainstorming, and that's been [long discredited as an effective vehicle for creative problem solving][Beyond Productivity Loss in Brainstorming Groups].

Mobbing is about writing code, and as described above, writing code is the least important thing we do.

## If we're not mobbing from dawn until dusk, what are we supposed to do?
The rest of the work that makes up the job of an engineer.

This includes, and is not limited to:
- Understanding the problem you're working on
- Adding information to upcoming tickets in the backlog
- Learning more about your tools
- Personal development

## If mobbing and collaboration aren't the same thing, then what's happening with the world?
Mobbing is one form of collaboration, and there are many other ways to collaborate.

In our field, these include, and are not limited to:
- Pairing
- Chatting over a coffee
- Code reviews
- Pairing/mobbing briefly to agree a design, before separating to implement it
- Documenting solutions for both others and your future self
