Choose _being_ agile over _doing_ agile

We expect our teams to be similar but different, shaped by the context they are in but expressing the same principles

What Andy Longshaw calls "2021 style software development" 

# Principles

* Working on everything _over_ working only in my specialism
* Working together _over_ working alone
* Releasing to users often _over_ accumulating changes
* Working at a pace we can maintain _over_ working with urgency
* Checking it was valuable _over_ meeting requirements

These are in git because they should change as we learn
